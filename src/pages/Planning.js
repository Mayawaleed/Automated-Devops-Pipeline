        It involves defining the project's objectives, requirements, and scope. 
        Teams outline what they aim to achieve, prioritize tasks, 
        and create user stories or feature descriptions. 
        The primary goals in this stage are to establish a clear roadmap and set expectations 
        for the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).</p>
